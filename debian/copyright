It was originally downloaded from
http://www.princeton.edu/~kmccarty/starplot.html
and was available to the public at http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov.

As of october 1, 2002, however, NASA discontinued the publication of this
data is now available at other Astronomical Data Center such as
CDS-France. The CDS service for astronomical catalogues is available at
http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cats/Cats.htx, and specifically, the catalog
of "Nearby Stars, Preliminary 3rd Version  (Gliese+ 1991)" can be
retrieved from: http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/Cat?V/70A

The catalog can be downloaded from
https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/star-catalog/cns3.html 
[verified March 2022]

The latest releases of this catalog, prepared for Starplot, are available at

COPYRIGHT NOTE

It is safe to redistribute the files in the orig-data directory,
which, as noted above, are freely available on Astronomical Data Center
web sites.  However, since these are copyrighted data, you may NOT redistribute
modified versions of them.  This is why some astronomic software in Debian
which uses this data has to either use this raw data or, if the program
wants to use another format, needs to parse and reformat this package's
data on postinst. For example, starplot will generate StarPlot-format data
files (*.stars) at install time instead of providing them in the package.
I would advise that you NOT redistribute these *.stars data files.  See
below for a detailed explanation.


The Makefile and .spec file of this data set are licensed under the GNU GPL 
either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
(GPL license file located in /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2),
of which you should have received a copy with the StarPlot documentation.
The GPL also applies to the text documentation (README, INSTALL) for this data
set, except where it would conflict with the licensing requirements described
below.  The GPL does ***NOT*** apply to the star data files enclosed or
generated.  The data files in the orig-data directory originate from the 
Astronomical Data Center (http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov) at NASA Goddard Space 
Flight Center, and are copyrighted by their respective authors.  Upon asking 
the ADC about the permissibility of their redistribution, I was told the
following:

        Yes, you are free to distribute the files with your program.
        Although, we do ask that you acknowledge, your source (the ADC)
        and the original authors.
        See: http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/adc/acknowledge_adc.html
        for more information.

My conclusions are that (1) you are free to redistribute the ADC data files.
However, (2) you must not delete any documentation giving credit for the data
files, for example in the README; and (3) the data files must NOT be altered in
any way (without permission of the original authors).  Therefore (4) it is NOT
permissible to redistribute the *.stars files which the StarPlot conversion
program creates from the ADC data files.  I have confirmed these conclusions
with the ADC.
