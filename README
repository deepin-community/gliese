This is a stellar data set for use by the StarPlot program.  You will need
to have StarPlot already installed in order to install this data set.
To download StarPlot, see the web page at http://www.starplot.org
or, if you are using Debian or a compatible system: apt-get install starplot

This directory should include the following files:

	README		This file.
	INSTALL		Instructions for installing this data set.
	COPYING		Information about the copyright of this data set.
	Changelog	History of the StarPlot incarnation of this data set.
	gliese3.spec	Specification of original data file format.
	orig-data/	Contains the unmodified data from the ADC archives.
	debian/		Control information for building a Debian package.

These data come from the Third Catalogue of Nearby Stars (preliminary
edition), Gliese and Jahreiss, 1991, which is located in the file
orig-data/catalog.dat and has an accompanying description in orig-data/ReadMe.
A StarPlot-readable file, gliese3.stars, will be automatically generated from
catalog.dat by starconvert, a conversion program, at install time.
After conversion, the file will contain approximately 3800 star records
including the known stars nearer to Earth than approximately 80 light-years.

The data set was obtained from the archives of the Astronomical Data
Center (ADC) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.  These archives are available
to the public at http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov.

COPYRIGHT NOTE

It is safe to redistribute the files in the orig-data directory,
which, as noted above, are freely available on the Astronomical Data Center
web site.  However, since these are copyrighted data, you may NOT redistribute
modified versions of them.  This is why I have the StarPlot-format data files,
*.stars, generated at install time instead of being available for download.
I would advise that you NOT redistribute these *.stars data files.  See the 
file COPYING for more information.
